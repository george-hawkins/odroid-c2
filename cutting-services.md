Online laser cutting firms
==========================

* [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/) and its offshoots [RazorLAB](http://www.razorlab.co.uk/) in the UK, [Formulor](http://www.formulor.de/) in Germany and [Vectorealism](https://en.vectorealism.com/) in Italy.

* [Sculpteo](https://www.sculpteo.com).

Ponoko is a little odd - the .com site only makes you aware of its US and New Zealand operations but will ship anywhere in the world - at a cost. Shipping can be much cheaper, depending on where you are, if you use one of its offshoots RazorLAB, Formulor or Vectorealism.

You can see the shipping costs for Formulor [here](http://www.formulor.de/help_en/cart.html) and for Vectorealism see [here](https://en.vectorealism.com/support/getting-started/costi-di-spedizione/). For Ponoko US/NZ and RazorLAB you'll have to create an account and go through the purchasing process to get to the point where you can see shipping costs.

Note: you can't use the same login for Ponoko and its offshoots, you have to register separate accounts on each, and you can't use the same email address as you used with one when registering with another. At least this is the case with Ponoko and RazorLAB - I haven't registered with Formulor or Vectorealism so it may or not be the same there.

I went with Sculpteo but Ponoko or its offshoots are probably cheaper for many destinations - in particular the US, NZ, UK, Germany and Italy.

Sizes
-----

Ponoko restricts you to a number of predefined sizes (see [here](http://www.ponoko.com/starter-kits/inkscape#inkscape_section_3)) while Sculpteo does not have such a constraint - it just has an upper size limit of 940x590mm (see [here](https://www.sculpteo.com/en/tutorial/prepare-your-model-laser-cutting-inkscape/)).
