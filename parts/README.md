Parts
=====

See the [Mouser parts list](https://george-hawkins.github.io/odroid-c2-cluster/parts/parts-mouser.htm) and a similar [parts list from Digikey](https://george-hawkins.github.io/odroid-c2-cluster/parts/parts-digikey.htm).

Metric vs imperial
------------------

Between Mouser and Digikey there's odd inconsistency in what's avaialble at a resonable price at size M3, i.e. metric, and the nearest equivalent in imperial, i.e. #4 / 4-40.

So in the Digikey parts list the spacer is sized for #4 while in the Mouser parts list the spacers are sized for M3.

For the metal screws, bolts and washers the situation is reversed with Digikey having M3 parts while Mouser has 4-40 parts.

The plastic screws and bolts are identical for both and are all M3.

Ethernet
--------

The Digikey ethernet cables are more expensive as they are shielded while the Mouser ones are not.

Digikey also has cheaper unshielded cables but Mouser does not have more expensive shielded ones.

Quantities
----------

Digikey automatically points out if you're near a price boundary and would get more of the same item for less if you order a few more, e.g. 50 bolts rather than 40.

Mouser does not point this out - you have to spot it. The only place where this was relevant was the plastic bolts (but oddly not for the plastic nuts).
